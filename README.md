##AFONIGIZER
This will be a bookmarklet that obsures ("afonigizes") peoples' identities on 
facebook and google+ for screenshots.

Currently, to use it, you paste it into your console in Firefox, Chrome, or 
Opera

###To do
* salt the robohash string w/ random num so it doesn't always return the same
picture (g+ username will always persist), so you can't "recreate" the shot
* map the names to an array and replace them rather than just truncating them
* get the names *in* the comments and replace them
* add a demo screenshot
