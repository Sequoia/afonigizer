##AFONIGIZER
This will be a bookmarklet that obsures ("afonigizes") people's identities on 
facebook and google+ (sort of google+) for screenshots.

Currently, to use it, you paste it into your console in Firefox, Chrome, or 
Opera

###To do
* -get first names list- shorten this list to ~100
* get last names list (nouns).
* randomize names list better
* add a demo screenshot
* check it in g+ again
* bookmarkletify it or whatever!!!!!!

###Known issues
* comments & posts not afonigized in google+, I can't figure how to handle the
dynamic classnames
