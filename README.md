##AFONIGIZER
This will be a bookmarklet that obsures ("afonigizes") people's identities on 
facebook and google+ (sort of google+) for screenshots.

Currently, to use it, you paste it into your console in Firefox, Chrome, or 
Opera *and then* ```afonigizer.doIt()```.  to bookmarkletify, put the script and the doIt call in an link href, but wrap the doIt call in ```void()```.

###To do
* add a demo screenshot
* check it in g+ again

###Known issues
* comments & posts not afonigized in google+, I can't figure how to handle the
dynamic classnames
