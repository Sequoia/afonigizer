##AFONIGIZER
This is a bookmarklet that obsures ("afonigizes") people's identities on 
facebook and google+ (sort of google+, haven't been testing) for screenshots.

Get the bookmarklet [here](http://sequoia.github.com/afonigizer/)

Currently, to use it, you paste it into your console in Firefox, Chrome, or 
Opera *and then* ```afonigizer.doIt()```.  to bookmarkletify, put the script and the doIt call in an link href, but wrap the doIt call in ```void()```.

###Known issues
* comments & posts not afonigized in google+, I can't figure how to handle the
dynamic classnames
